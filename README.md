`minty` (*min*imal *ty*pe inferencing) is an experimental package to
extract the type inferencing tools from `readr` (see this issue
[tidyverse/readr\#1517](https://github.com/tidyverse/readr/issues/1517)).

The goal of this package is to be the drop-in replacement of
`readr::type_convert()` and the [so-called “readr v1” parsing
engine](https://github.com/tidyverse/readr?tab=readme-ov-file#editions).

## Installation

You can install the development version of minty like so:
